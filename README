Experiments based on papers https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11357, https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06060.


Implemented
[x] Version of i SIR and correlated i SIR in simple setting
[x] Toy experients on Gaussians
[x] correlated AI SIR
[x] Different ULA and MALA samplers
[x] Experiments on MCMC GAN stuff

To Do
[] Develop Ex^2 MCMC with part i-SIR and part MALA for refreshment kernel
[] Implement more enhanced version of correlation (Achille to write on overleaf)
[] Put Adaptive i-SIR in pipeline from flow and adaptive_mc files
[] Implement examples as in SA MCMC 

To complete while we advance to NeurIPS !! :)
